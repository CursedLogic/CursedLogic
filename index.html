    <p class="centered-text">
      Why are you so loud? <br />
      Real G's move in silence, like lasagna <br />
      I'm introverted, how much more do you need?
    </p>

    <p class="centered-text">Needy I see...</p>

    <p class="centered-text">
      I don't have enough of an opinion formed about you, <br />
      to even spark a desire to talk with you. <br />
      What's your humor level? What kind of hobbies do you have? <br />
      Will you get offended easily? <br />
      If the answer is "yes" to being offended easily, <br />
      that's the reason I don't talk with you. <br />
      These are all things to consider before even wanting to talk with you,
      <br />
      otherwise it's just small talk which I hate. <br />
      "What's up?" The fucking ceiling <br />
      "How are you?" I'm fine like every other time anyone asks <br />
      Political? I love guns. <br />
      Religious? No thanks <br />
      Sports? No thanks <br />
      Movies? No thanks <br />
      Music? Louder and darker than you'd think <br />
      Video Games? On PC, and no you probably don't know the games I play<br />
      Red Dead Redemption? no, League of Legends? no, Competitive shooters? no,
      MMO's? no, and RPG's? no.
    </p>

    <p class="centered-text">
      I don't want to learn your life story and hear how hard you have it. <br />
      I don't want to compete, I don't have anything to prove to you <br />
      I don't even care about your opinion.<br />
      Are we working together? I'm professional enough to work with you, <br />
      but that's it. If you have a work question, ask.
